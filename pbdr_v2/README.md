### Things changes from pbdr_v1:

- SAT LF and UHF bands now same as LAT.
- LAT UHF wafer layout, detector count, horn size now same as SAT.
- CHLAT new baseline elevation is 40 deg, not 35deg.

Notes:  
- carrier_index = beta = 2.7 as default.  This is (approximately) the highest of the fab-reported values.

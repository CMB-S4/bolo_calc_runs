Plan:

  Run/document updated version of all telescopes, all channels with:
  
  - floating Psat, for flat bands, then logistic bands.  Compare Psats and NETs.
  - Run LF's with floating low band edge, to show NET dependence.
  - Run all NET and NEg_pwv optimizations over band center/width to show where we are.
  
  Use the default logistic values to redetermine target Psats.
  Then:
  - Set all Psats to fixed for remainder of runs:
  - Run with higher optics temp (esp nylon, alumina) to see that NET dependence.
   

Katie Harrington's input on LATR, via slack on 1/18/2023:
-12 RTMLI layers [currently 10 layers]
-alumina anywhere from 40-90K (90 is high but would explore the whole space).  [currently 50K]
-alumina anywhere from 3-15mm thick (each wedge is different) [currently 10mm]
-nylon anywhere from 4-20K (20 is also high) [currently 4K]
-nylon thickness 3-6mm (It's in the model at 4mm but would be curious about changing it in case it matters)  [currently 7.5mm]
